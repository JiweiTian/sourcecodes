Step of the running project:

1.	Open this project in your Netbeans IDE.
2.	Run (Computaion.java) file.
3.	First, we need a choice second option to create a dataset.
4.	Enter the number of ports of switches (basically switches comes 4 ports, 8 ports, 16 ports, 24 ports, 32 ports And so on) only enter the number.
5.	Enter the number of applications depends on three different experiments. 
6.	Automatically created a data set file in the same directory with the name of the number of port switches and application number that already entered.
7.	Then rerun the project and choose the first option (Load dataset) to get the result of 4 different algorithms. 
8.	Finally, we can repeat this process to create a new dataset and get the results.
9.  For comparison, please run the 'MinPR_Final.cpp' and follow the PDF file 'MinPR_Final.pdf'
