This document illustrates how to run the source code:

1. This code is run in windows 10 and compiled by Pycharm, and programming language is python3.7. Before running the code, you need to install the following packages:  numpy, pandas, XLRD, and sklearn.
2. "Elman.py" is the main file, and "normalization.py" is the data processing file.
3. When running models of different data sets, it is necessary to modify different training sets in "Elman.py" file, respectively.
(such as for I/O intensive data, it needs to be revised in "Elman.py" file.  datafile = u'data\\io_train.xlsx' datafile1 = u'data\\io_test.xlsx'ï¼‰.
4. Run the "Elman.py" file to generate an Excel file with predicted values in the current path.
